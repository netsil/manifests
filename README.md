## About
Netsil Application Operations Center (AOC) is a next-gen observability and analytics tool for modern cloud applications. The Netsil AOC helps SREs and DevOps improve the reliability and performance of API and microservices-driven production applications.

At the heart of the AOC is an auto-discovered service topology map. It visualizes service dependencies and operational metrics so practitioners can work collaboratively across teams. 

## Introduction
Installation is done in two parts: **Netsil AOC** and the **Netsil Collectors**.

The collectors are installed on your application instances (VMs or containerized environments) and mirror the service interactions & metrics back to Netsil AOC for real-time analysis.

You may install the collectors in a variety of environments, independent of the AOC environment.
For instance, you may run the AOC as a standalone docker container, but install the collectors in Kubernetes.
